# Data Modeling With Apache Cassandra-project
## Description:
Sparkify, a music streaming startup, wants insights into their user listening behavior. Currently, data is stored in CSV files, making querying difficult. They need an Apache Cassandra database to enable efficient song play queries. As a data engineer, I designed a data model to support the analysis team in generating valuable insights.
